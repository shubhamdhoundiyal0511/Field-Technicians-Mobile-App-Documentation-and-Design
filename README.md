# Field-Technicians-Mobile-App-Documentation-and-Design
This project involves the comprehensive documentation and functional design for a mobile application tailored for field technicians performing asset audits. The primary goal of the application is to streamline asset management processes by providing features such as audit scheduling, asset tracking, QR code scanning, and offline data management.

The project deliverables include:
Business Requirement Document (BRD): Detailed analysis of business problems and proposed solutions.
Storyboard: Step-by-step user journey through the application, capturing all key interactions.
User Stories: Clearly defined user-centric requirements outlining the functionality of the app.
Wireframes: Visual representation of the appâ€™s interface and navigation flow.
Functional Specifications: Description of the functionality of each screen and interaction, ensuring technical alignment with business needs.

This project was designed to improve productivity, enhance data accuracy, and reduce operational inefficiencies for field technicians. It serves as a template for implementing user-centered design and technical requirements for mobile application development.
